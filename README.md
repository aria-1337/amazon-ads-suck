# amazon-ads-suck
v1 of amazon prime video "adblocker". replaces ads with a simple blackscreen and a countdown of time remaining. (as well as mutes)

### Install it locally:

I will publish it to chrome but they have to approve it. in the meantime you can do the following:

1) clone this repo
2) go to `chrome://extensions` in your chrome browser
3) in the upper right toggle `Developer mode`
4) select the `load unpacked` button in the upper left
then it should be in your extensions! 

### Known bugs
- Doesn't re-enter fullscreen, this is kinda tricky and the only potential fix would be to switch it from an extension to an app...

### Things id like to do
- Add a feature to upload/set some kind of content during the ad breaks
- See if its possible to truly skip ads
