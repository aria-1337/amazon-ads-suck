# amazon-ads-suck
v1 of amazon prime video "adblocker". replaces ads with a simple blackscreen and a countdown of time remaining. (as well as mutes)

### Install it locally:

I will publish it to chrome but they have to approve it. in the meantime you can do the following:

1) clone this repo
2) go to `chrome://extensions` in your chrome browser
3) in the upper right toggle `Developer mode`
4) select the `load unpacked` button in the upper left
then it should be in your extensions! 

Feature development:
- Ability to add your own content to overlay during ads
- Actually circumvent the ad (this may not be possible)
